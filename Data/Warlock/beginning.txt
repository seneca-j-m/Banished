BEGINNING

Lightning splinters the sky, thunder cracks the crowds.
Held, by rope and wood, a steel cage dangles suspended off the side of the Gilded Mountain.
So it is, the precarious East of the great Mount named ‘Ruins edge’; infamous for being the place of the doomed: those cast out from Prosperity Castle for crimes unspeakable. 
Those who dare to wander, find a barren and coarse terrain, marked only by Retribution Pillar - a towering wooden structure, atop of which lies a round ball of steel, attracting perpetual storms. 
Tied to the base of the pillar, are four chain link lines connecting to the base of it leading off the cliff. Impaled in the side of Ruins Edge are three wooden suspensions, each dangling - by thin rope - steel metal cages holding the corpses of three prisoners doomed to starvation until death. 
Yet, grace would smile upon one of these unfortunates. The heavens open and rare Effulgence shines, its rays piercing the steel cage and possessing the rotten body lying inside. 
Imbued with Moonglow, the forsaken arises, sputtering as air fills old lungs and strength flows through older limbs. 
With a mighty shout, the Warlock arises. 
Clad in tatters; a meagre grey tunic, worn and ripped; a pair of equally dreary breeches, held together by sheer will - garments of the doomed - much like their owner. 
Slowly the Warlock rights itself, memory lost, and peers through the bars of his prison. The crags of the Judiciary lies below him, mighty pikes of stone standing loyal to tear and rip flesh should the rope that holds the cage snap. A fierce wind whips through, rocking the cage and testing the rope, swinging the Warlock’s prison to and fro.
A stunning blue ray beckons the Warlock past the cliff edge, to where lightning converges. It is there he will find its property, its precipice, its purpose. 
Revenge solely occupies the mind of the Warlock, and the Realm awaits his wrath.
The Night bestows its title upon the creature: Spectre.
