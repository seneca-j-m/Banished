DECRIPTIONEND

BEGINNING
The air is foul. Filled with the dust and grime of decades gone. Deep within the Catacombs of the Doom, decay dribbles down the cold stone walls.

In the furthest and darkest corner of the Catacombs, a modest stone coffin, portly in its construction, is situated against the far wall. Within, lay an old battler, long since claimed by the Night. 

But now, the heavens open, and under the grace of Luna, Effulgence showers through the cracked and dilapidated casket. Rays of the moon: a trumpet beckoning the creature inside to take up his sword once more; not for the kingdom he once did long before, but for the entire Realm. 

A splintering crack shatters the stone lid of the grave and the power of the Moon channels into the fibre of the Knight which lay there.

Slowly, he props his body up on the sides of his coffin, and arises, feeling proper ground under his feet after endless time. He turns back and reaches for his Longsword and Heavy Shield - imbued with Moonglow. 

The knight rights himself, standing in front of the door he was destined to never leave. 

A slithering blue light beckons him forward, a path in the darkness. 

The battler stands at his precipice - the Realm awaits;

and the Night bestows its title: Spectre.
