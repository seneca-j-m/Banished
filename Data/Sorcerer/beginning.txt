BEGINNING
Rolling hills; sunken grey earth mounds - all life vanquished long ago. A ruined Minor Temple, an old construction of stone and brick, stands atop one of these mounds. Cracked and peeling, the worshipers of the God to which this temple was dedicated have long since faded.
Within however, light glows yet on a particular grey morning. Five worshipers, priests all, stand in front of a stone statue. They are arranged in a semi-circle, each with gold items, sticks and seals, undulating in unison and chanting in old tongue. 
Light streams from the grey sky and shoots through the collapsed roof of the temple, possessing the statue. 
The chanting of the priests' increases, and the statue splinters: first the legs, then the torso, then the head. The stone prison of this great herald now shattered and the long-dead corpse falls to his knees, breathing hard. 
The priests retreat in fear, and Effulgence regenerates the Sorcerer in front of their very eyes. Tired limbs, refreshed anew, and tattered tunic formed into masterful dress. 
The Sorcerer's eyes glow with a terrible blue, a creature reborn, without memory and purpose. 
The light which gave him strength leads him out the door of the cathedral, and he rises to his feet to meet the persists. 
The head of the circle, comes forward, timidly, presenting a wooden casket. Opening it, the Sorcerer's eyes glint with power and remembrance: a Sacred Staff, weapon of the Spellcasters. 
Taking it, feeling its weight, he plants it into the ground firmly. The temple shakes and blue Moonglow fills the area, terrifying the priests. The Sorcerer has awoken.
While knowing not his past, the mighty caster knows his destiny. 
The grey clouds thunder, the Night bestows its title: Spectre.
